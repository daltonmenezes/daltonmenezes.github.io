title: "Developers must be lazy?"
---
I don't know about other idioms, but in portuguese I see this quite widespread sentence around the internet. But it is correct? What I say is that yes and no, depending on how you understood it.

### What does this not mean?
It does not mean that you should postpone your studies, your work and projects, your evolution.

### So, What does this mean?
that you should, as a programmer, automate everything as much as possible on the solution you are programming, for not to have to repeat a long process to get a result and to facilitate your life and the others who use the developed solution by you. This sentence is about to have a smooth and efficient workflow in your development environment.

There are how you automate processes repeated on the terminal? There are tools that can streamline your work? You know how to create features that will optimize your processes and other programmers? To solve more easily and in less time a problem? This sentence is about that. About intelligence!

So, if you assimilated the sentence to lazy to study, develop, and everything else that will make you evolve, I'm speaking to you that it is not a subterfuge for it.

Be smart and make your way to solving a problem is minimized. That what you're developing optimize and facilitate your life and the lives of people. Do not be stagnant with the false protection about a sentence that you possibly misinterpreted it and you feel welcomed.
