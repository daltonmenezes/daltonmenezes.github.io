title: "What is the quickest way to evolve?"

Would that be the one million dollars question? Well, if the question costs one million dollars I do not know, but the answer is certainly free and simple: erring, taking out these errors of anonymity and allow to other more experienced people to help you get it right.

### so, is it that simple?

Yes, it is. What is difficult is to fight against our own ego, against our fears and have courage to show ourselves and take a chance so that others show us where we are going wrong and how we can evolve from that. After all, in anonymity we do not have good awareness about our mistakes.

Some of my friends are still afraid to create their accounts on github or show their codes. I confess that I have also experienced it. But what do we sacrifice in the name of anonymity? We just sacrifice our quickest evolution.

The github consists in different kinds of developers and levels of knowledge, if you allow me here parameterize knowledge. Knowing this, is it worth not take advantage about what this platform brings to us?

Have the courage to show your codes, have other people looking at it and improving, arguing with you about what is wrong or what can be improved is fantastic and allows us to the aforementioned quickest evolution compared to the anonymity of our codes.

How about you lose that fear and allow yourself to evolve with the help of others? I dare you to create now your github account and post your projects. ;)
